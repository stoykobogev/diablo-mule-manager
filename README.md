# diablo-mule-manager

Desktop app for managing mule inventories for Diablo 2: LoD. The app is crude and more of a proof of concept than anything else but it can still be used.

# Guide

Requires JDK 11 and up (https://adoptopenjdk.net/). There's a "start.bat" and compiled JAR in folder "shade".

There are two tabs - "View" and "Add/Edit"

In "View" you can see the mules and their inventory on the left side. On the right side you see complete list of the items in all mules.

In "Add/Edit" you create and edit mules and their items. There are no popups so be careful not to click "Delete" unintentionally. To add new mule select "New.." from the dropdown and continue with the creation.
